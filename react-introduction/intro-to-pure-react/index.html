<!-- This is the purent react code you'll see. We have not mixed babel into this. We've used react in the most pure manner. -->

<!-- Just go through the above code and absorb it. Ask me any doubts after going through it. I'll be back in 2-3 mins. -->

<!-- Whatever that is being done by reactJs can be done by plain javascript as well. Just that reactJs makes our work a lot more simpler. -->
