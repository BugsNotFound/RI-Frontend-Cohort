Whenever we render something on the webpage, react-js first makes the update in the virtual DOM. (Vritual DOM just means DOM Tree which is stored in the memory. 
And since it's stored in the memory, it's faster to makeschanged to it). 
So whenever react renders anything on the webpage, it compares the old dom with the new virtal dom. Then it makes only the neccessary changes in the webpage. 
It used an algorithem called 'diffing algorithm'. Using the diffing algorithm reactJs finds out the differences b/w the two doms.. 



We can only inject js expressions within jsx (by using {}). if, while..etc aren't javascript expressions. That is why we can't inject it into our jsx code.
